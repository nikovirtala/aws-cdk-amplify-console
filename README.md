# AWS Amplify Console with AWS CDK

This is an example of configuring AWS Amplify Console deployment using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

- [AWS Amplify Console](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/)
- [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/index.html)
- [aws-amplify CDK module](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-amplify-readme.html)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
